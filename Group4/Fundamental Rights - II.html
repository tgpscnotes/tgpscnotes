<button class="accordion"><strong>Introduction: The Triad of Justice</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">

<div class="equality-intro-box">

<p>
The <strong>Right to Equality</strong> is the first and most fundamental right guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. It forms the foundation of all other Fundamental Rights and serves as the cornerstone of democratic governance.
</p>

<p>
This right is enshrined in <strong>Articles 14 to 18 of Part III</strong> of the Constitution.
</p>

</div>


<div class="equality-philosophy-box">

<p>
The philosophy of equality does not mean treating everyone identically in all situations. Instead, it promotes <strong>proportional equality (equity)</strong>, where:
</p>

<ul class="equality-points">
<li>Persons in equal circumstances are treated equally.</li>
<li>Persons in unequal circumstances are treated differently to ensure fairness and justice.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class="equality-keypoint">

<strong>Key Point:</strong> The Right to Equality ensures both:
<ul class="equality-subpoints">
<li><strong>Equality before Law</strong> – No person is above the law.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Protection of Laws</strong> – Equal treatment under similar conditions.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Rule of Law -->
<h3>A. Rule of Law and Article 14</h3>

<div class="rule-of-law-box">
The concept of Equality before Law is based on the Rule of Law, propounded by A.V. Dicey.
</div>

<ul class="rule-list">

<li>
<strong>Absence of Arbitrary Power:</strong> No person can be punished except according to law.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Equality before Law:</strong> No person is above the law.

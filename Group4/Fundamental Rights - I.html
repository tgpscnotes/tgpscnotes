<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Introduction to Fundamental Rights</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">
<div class="fr-intro-box">

<p>
Fundamental Rights are enshrined in <strong>Part III of the Indian Constitution (Articles 12 to 35)</strong>. They are regarded as the <strong>"conscience of the Constitution"</strong> (Granville Austin) and are essential for the overall development of individuals.
</p>

</div>


<ul class="fr-points">

<li>
<strong>Source:</strong> Fundamental Rights are inspired by the <strong>Bill of Rights of the USA</strong>, especially the first ten amendments.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> They aim to establish the <strong>Rule of Law</strong> and prevent arbitrary exercise of power by the State. They ensure a government of law and not of men.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Justiciability:</strong> Fundamental Rights are enforceable by courts. Citizens can directly approach:
<ul class="fr-subpoints">
<li><strong>Supreme Court under Article 32</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Courts under Article 226</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>


<div class="fr-keypoint">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Fundamental Rights are not absolute. The State can impose <strong>reasonable restrictions</strong> in the interest of public order, morality, sovereignty, and security of the State.

Fundamental Rights can be amended by Parliament, provided the amendment does not violate the Basic Structure Doctrine.
</td>

<td>
During a National Emergency, Fundamental Rights can be suspended except Articles 20 and 21.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>6. Available Against State</strong></td>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Enforceability of Fundamental Rights</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">
<!-- Against State -->
<h3>A. Against the State (Vertical Application)</h3>

<div class="fr-enforceability-box">
The primary function of Fundamental Rights is to protect individuals from arbitrary actions of the State. As defined under <strong>Article 12</strong>, any violation by the State or its agencies can be challenged before the courts.
</div>


<!-- Against Private Individuals -->
<h3>B. Against Private Individuals (Horizontal Application)</h3>

<div class="fr-horizontal-intro">
Traditionally, Fundamental Rights were enforceable only against the State. However, the Supreme Court has expanded their scope to include private individuals and organizations when their actions affect public functions or violate individual dignity and equality.

<table class="fr-case-table">

<tr>
<th>Case</th>
<th>Context</th>
<th>Significance</th>

<tr>
<td><strong>Kameshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar (1962)</strong></td>
<td>Private individuals acting under State direction.</td>
<td>Extended Fundamental Rights obligations to private actors acting as agents of the State.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>PUDR v. Police Commissioner, Delhi (1983)</strong></td>
<td>Labour rights violated by private contractors with State involvement.</td>
<td>State must protect individuals from rights violations by private actors.</td>

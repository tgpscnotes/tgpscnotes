<strong>Panchayati Raj System: An Overview</strong>
</button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">
<div class="container">


<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Panchayati Raj System represents the oldest system of local governance in the Indian subcontinent, institutionalizing the concept of grassroots democracy. It envisions the village as the basic unit of governance where people participate directly in decision-making processes affecting their lives.
</p>

<p>
The term <strong>"Panchayati Raj"</strong> literally means <strong>"rule by five individuals"</strong>, referring to the traditional village councils that have existed in India since ancient times.
</p>

<p>
The modern Panchayati Raj system gained constitutional status through the <strong>73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992</strong>, which established it as the third tier of India's federal democracy.
</p>

<p>
This amendment was based on the Gandhian principle enshrined in <strong>Article 40 of the Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>, which calls upon the State to organize village panchayats and endow them with necessary powers to function as units of self-government.
</p>

<div class="keypoint">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Panchayati Raj represents grassroots democracy and decentralized governance in India.
</div>

<div class="quote">
Mahatma Gandhi envisioned a decentralized democracy where every village would be a republic. He famously stated:<br><br>
"If we would see our dream of Panchayat Raj, i.e., true democracy realized, we would regard the humblest and lowest Indian as being equally the ruler of India with the tallest in the land."

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Introduction: Why Amend a Constitution?</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">

<div class="intro-content">

<p>
The framers of the Indian Constitution recognized that a Constitution must be a <strong>living document</strong>. It should evolve with time to meet the changing needs of society, address emerging challenges, and reflect the aspirations of future generations.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, they incorporated a well-balanced amendment procedure that is neither too rigid like the <strong>US Constitution</strong> nor too flexible like the <strong>British system</strong>.
</p>

</div>


<ul class="amendment-points">

<li>
<strong>Article 368</strong> in <strong>Part XX</strong> of the Constitution provides Parliament with the power and procedure to amend the Constitution.
</li>

</ul>


<div class="key-point">

<strong>Key Point:</strong> The power to amend the Constitution is a <strong>constituent power</strong>, which is higher than ordinary legislative power and enables Parliament to modify constitutional provisions.

</div>

</div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Procedure for Amendment (Article 368) </strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">
<div class="procedure-intro">
The amendment process can be initiated only in either House of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha), and not in the State Legislatures.
</div>

<ul class="procedure-points">

<li>
<strong>Initiation:</strong> A Constitutional Amendment Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament by a Minister or a Private Member.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Prior Permission of President:</strong> The President’s prior permission is <strong>not required</strong> to introduce the amendment bill.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Passing in Parliament:</strong>
<ul class="sub-points">
<li>The bill must be passed separately in each House of Parliament.</li>
<li>It must be passed by a <strong>Special Majority</strong>.</li>
<li>There is <strong>no provision for Joint Sitting</strong> in case of disagreement between the two Houses.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<strong>State Ratification (if required):</strong> Amendments affecting federal provisions must be ratified by at least <strong>one-half of the State Legislatures</strong> by a simple majority.
</li>

<li>
<strong>President’s Assent:</strong> After passing Parliament (and State ratification, if required), the bill is presented to the President. The President <strong>must give assent</strong> and cannot withhold or return it.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Final Step:</strong> After the President’s assent, the bill becomes a <strong>Constitutional Amendment Act</strong>.
</li>

</ul>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Introduction: The "Heart and Soul" of the Constitution</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">

<div class="article32-intro">

<p>
After guaranteeing Fundamental Rights (Articles 14–31), the Constitution provides a powerful mechanism to enforce them through <strong>Article 32</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar described Article 32 as the <strong>"Heart and Soul of the Constitution"</strong> because it ensures effective protection of Fundamental Rights.
</p>

</div>


<div class="ambedkar-quote-box">

<strong>Ambedkar's Famous Statement:</strong>

<p>
"If I was asked to name any particular article in this Constitution as the most important—an article without which this Constitution would be a nullity—I could not refer to any other article except this one. It is the very heart and soul of the Constitution."
</p>

</div>


<ul class="article32-points">

<li>
<strong>Article 32 gives citizens the right to directly approach the Supreme Court</strong> for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Article 226 gives similar power to High Courts</strong>, and its scope is wider as it covers both Fundamental Rights and other legal rights.
</li>

</ul>


<div class="article32-keypoint">

<strong>Key Point:</strong> The right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 is itself a Fundamental Right, making it the strongest protector of constitutional liberty.

<button class="accordion"><strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL) </strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">

<div class="pil-intro">

<p>
Public Interest Litigation (PIL), though not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, has evolved as a powerful judicial tool to protect Fundamental Rights, especially for the poor, marginalized, and disadvantaged sections of society.
</p>

</div>


<!-- Origin and Development -->
<h3>Origin and Development</h3>

<ul class="pil-points">

<li>
<strong>Origin:</strong> PIL originated in the United States and was introduced in India by Justice P.N. Bhagwati and Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer.
</li>

<li>
<strong>First PIL Case:</strong> Mumbai Kamgar Sabha v. Abdul Bhai (1976) – Allowed a union to approach the court on behalf of workers.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Landmark PIL Case:</strong> Hussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar (1979) – Led to release of thousands of undertrial prisoners.
</li>

</ul>


<!-- Locus Standi -->
<h3>Relaxation of Rule of Locus Standi</h3>

<div class="pil-box">

<p>
Traditionally, only an aggrieved person could approach the court. PIL relaxed this rule, allowing any public-spirited person or organization to approach the court on behalf of victims unable to seek justice.
</p>

</div>


<!-- Guidelines -->
<h3>Guidelines to Prevent Misuse</h3>

<ul class="pil-points">

<li>No PIL allowed in service matters.</li>

<li>No PIL for personal or political gain.</li>

<li>PIL must be filed in genuine public interest.</li>

<li>Courts verify authenticity before accepting PIL.</li>

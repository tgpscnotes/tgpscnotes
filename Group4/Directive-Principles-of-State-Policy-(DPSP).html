<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Introduction: The Conscience of the Constitution</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">
<div class="dpsp-intro-box">

<p>
While Fundamental Rights (Part III) ensure political democracy, the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)</strong> in Part IV (Articles 36–51) aim to establish <strong>social and economic democracy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Granville Austin described DPSP as the <strong>"Conscience of the Constitution"</strong> because they guide the State in building a Welfare State.
</p>

</div>


<h3>Source of DPSP</h3>

<div class="dpsp-source-box">

<p>
The concept of DPSP was borrowed from the <strong>Irish Constitution of 1937</strong>, which itself was influenced by the Spanish Constitution.
</p>

</div>


<h3>Philosophy and Objectives</h3>

<ul class="dpsp-points">

<li>
DPSP provide guidelines to the legislature and executive to govern the country effectively.
</li>

<li>
They aim to achieve justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity as promised in the Preamble.
</li>

<li>
They promote the establishment of a Welfare State focused on social and economic justice.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Nature of DPSP</h3>

<div class="dpsp-nature-box">

<p>
Directive Principles are <strong>non-justiciable</strong>, meaning they cannot be enforced by courts.
</p>

<p>
However, under <strong>Article 37</strong>, they are declared <strong>fundamental in the governance of the country</strong>, and it is the duty of the State to apply them while making laws.
</p>

</div>


<div class="dpsp-keypoint">

<strong>Key Point:</strong> If Fundamental Rights are the "right hand" of the Constitution (what the State cannot do), DPSP are the "left hand" (what the State must do).

</div>

</div>
</div>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<button class="accordion"><strong>Article 36: Definition</strong></button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-content">

<div class="article36-intro">

<p>
Article 36 provides that the term <strong>"State"</strong> in Part IV (Directive Principles of State Policy) has the same meaning as defined in Part III (Fundamental Rights).
</p>

</div>
</div>

<strong>Article 37 states:</strong>
"The provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws."
</p>

</div>


<div class="article37-intro">

<p>
Article 37 defines the unique constitutional status of Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). Although they cannot be enforced by courts, they remain essential for governance and policy-making.
